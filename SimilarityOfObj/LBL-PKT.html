<dt>
<b>Description</b>
<dd>
These traces each contain an hour's worth of all wide-area traffic between
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the rest of the world.
<dt>
<b>Format</b>
<dd>
The traces were reduced from
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z><em>tcpdump</em></a>
format to ASCII using the
<a href=sanitize.html> sanitize</a> scripts.  They include five files:
<em>lbl-pkt-<b>n</b>.tcp</em> (TCP packets),
<em>lbl-pkt-<b>n</b>.sf</em> (TCP SYN/FIN/RST packets),
<em>lbl-pkt-<b>n</b>.udp</em> (UDP packets),
<em>lbl-pkt-<b>n</b>.encap</em> (encapsulated IP - MBone),
and <em>lbl-pkt-<b>n</b>.other</em> (whatever else was in the trace).
<dt>
<b>Measurement</b>
<dd>
The trace <b>lbl-pkt-4</b> ran from 14:00 to 15:00 on Friday,
January 21, 1994, and <b>lbl-pkt-5</b> ran from 14:00 to 15:00 on
Friday, January 28, 1994 (times
are Pacific Standard Time).  Each captured 1.3 million TCP packets, the
first dropping about 0.0007 of the total, the second about 0.0005.
The tracing was done on the Ethernet DMZ network over
which flows all traffic into or out of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
located in Berkeley, California.
The raw traces were made using 
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z><em>tcpdump</em></a>
on a Sun Sparcstation using the
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z>BPF</a>
kernel packet filter.  Timestamps have microsecond precision.
<dt>
<b>Privacy</b>
<dd>
The traces have been "sanitized" using the
<a href=sanitize.html> sanitize</a> scripts.  This means that
the host IP addresses have been renumbered, and all packet contents
removed.
